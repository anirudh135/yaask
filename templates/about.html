We focus particularly on Mathematics, Language, and Programming, subjects that can be powerful tools to forward one’s ambitions in life, but are often lost to ‘knowledge centric learning’ - being treated as facts and formulae to be memorized and repeated in tests. At Yaask, by focussing on skill based learning,  we aim to make sinister sounding subjects more real and intuitive, without losing their curricular relevance. We aim to enable students to see their curriculum as something they can engage with practically in a tangible setting, allowing them to learn with greater comprehension and retention, guiding them to success not only in test scores, but also in putting their knowledge to work for the benefit of themselves and the world.";

Prior to founding Yaask Labs soaham was most recently engaged at Excelsior American School, Gurgaon as a teacher for Mathematics and Physics - where he had been researching the school education scene from the inside, to better understand its challenges and opportunities.",
